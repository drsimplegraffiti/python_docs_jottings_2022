A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended. Within a module, the moduleâ€™s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable __name__.
A module can contain executable statements as well as function definitions.
from fibo import *


The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat directories containing the file as packages.

In the simplest case, __init__.py can just be an empty file, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the __all__ variable, described later.
